Name:
	kale â€” hightlight streamed text.
Usage:
	kale [-e | --regexp] [-f | --fixed-string] [-g | --group-regexp] <pattern>...
	kale [-d | --default]
	kale (-h | --help | --version)

Description:

	Kale (colour-tail -> cail -> kale) behaves similarily to tail's live-follow mode, but with
	extra support for highlighting streamed text.

	1. Each literal string or regexp match is automatically highlighted with a seperate style.
	2. Capturing groups can be treated as seperate matches.

Options:
	-d, --default         Default, log-format agnostic highlighting.
	-e, --regexp          Treat provided patterns as non-capture group regular expressions.
	-f, --fixed-string    Treat provided patterns as literal strings.
	-g, --group-regexp    Treat provided patterns as capture group regular expressions.
	-h, --help            Display this documentation.
	--version             Display the package version.

Arguments:
	<pattern>...          The text or regular expression pattern(s) to highlight.
